# _Custom Roles for TTT_ Roles Pack for Jingle Jam 2022
A pack of [Custom Roles for TTT](https://github.com/NoxxFlame/TTT-Custom-Roles) roles created based on the generous donations of our community members in support of [Jingle Jam 2022](https://www.jinglejam.co.uk/).

# Roles

## Shadow
_Suggested By_: Noxx\
The Shadow is an independent role whose goal is to stay close to their target without causing too much suspicion.
\
\
**ConVars**
```cpp
ttt_shadow_enabled                    0   // Whether or not the shadow should spawn
ttt_shadow_spawn_weight               1   // The weight assigned to spawning the shadow
ttt_shadow_min_players                0   // The minimum number of players required to spawn the shadow
ttt_shadow_start_timer                30  // How much time (in seconds) the shadow has to find their target at the start of the round
ttt_shadow_buffer_timer               7   // How much time (in seconds) the shadow can stay of their target's radius without dying
ttt_shadow_alive_radius               8   // The radius (in meters) from the living target that the shadow has to stay within
ttt_shadow_dead_radius                3   // The radius (in meters) from the death target that the shadow has to stay within
```
